## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added

**Layout Composition (`[DS-LAYOUT-COMP]`)**

A new subsection under §1 Spacing covering structural layout decisions that AI models consistently get wrong. Six rules with IDs `DS-LAYOUT-COMP-001` through `DS-LAYOUT-COMP-006`:

- Sibling spacing always belongs to the parent container via `gap`, not directional padding on child elements
- No wrapper divs without a layout purpose (flex/grid context, overflow control, stacking context, or semantic grouping)
- `min-width: 0` on flex children containing text or overflow-prone content — prevents the default `min-width: auto` from causing invisible overflow bugs
- No `width: 100%` on flex/grid children when the parent is already controlling sizing
- `aspect-ratio` over the old padding-top percentage hack for ratio-constrained containers
- `object-fit` required on any image with explicit dimensions

**Expanded Semantic HTML (`[DS-A11Y-011]` through `[DS-A11Y-017]`)**

Seven new rules added to the Semantic HTML section under §8 Accessibility:

- `<ul>`/`<ol>` for lists — not stacked `<div>` siblings
- `<br>` only for intentional content line breaks (addresses, poetry) — never for layout spacing
- `loading="lazy"` on below-the-fold images; explicitly excluded from hero and above-the-fold content
- `<time datetime="...">` for all dates and times in content
- Heading elements (`<h1>`–`<h6>`) for document structure only — not for font size control
- `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for grouped radio and checkbox controls, with before/after examples

**Selectors and Specificity (`[DS-CSS-002]` through `[DS-CSS-006]`)**

New subsection under §10 CSS Architecture:

- No `#id` selectors for styling
- Selectors capped at 2 levels of nesting before a new class is warranted
- `:is()` for grouping selectors without multiplying specificity, with example
- `:where()` for zero-specificity base styles that are easy to override
- Separation of layout concerns (sizing, position) from visual concerns (color, border, font) in hand-authored CSS

**Media Queries (`[DS-CSS-007]`)**

New subsection under §10 CSS Architecture:

- `em` over `px` for breakpoint values in hand-authored `@media` queries — respects user browser font size preferences and scales correctly on zoom
- Reference table of common breakpoints in `em` with `px` equivalents
- Scoped to hand-authored CSS; notes that Tailwind's built-in breakpoints use `px` internally

### Changed

- **Version bump:** `1.1.0` → `1.2.0`
- **Pre-Submit Checklist:** All existing checklist items now include their `[DS-*]` rule IDs. Nine new checklist items added across Accessibility, Layout, and a new CSS section
- **Quick Reference table:** Eight new rows covering the most common situations addressed by the new rules
- **Section headers:** All section headers now include their `[DS-*]` group tag for consistency with inline rules

### Fixed

- `[DS-A11Y]` rule numbering: the Color and Meaning rule was unnumbered in v1.1.0. Assigned `[DS-A11Y-017]`
